Sentiment Analysis of Twitter data using ML algorithms
Abstract
The Real time Sentiment Analysis for Social Media using Machine Learning project aims to develop a system that can analyze the sentiment of social media posts in real time. It involves two processes- Machine Learning technique and Knowledge based approach. It will basically target social media- Twitter, which has a word limit of only 140. The system will use machine learning algorithms to analyze the text of social media posts and categorize them as positive, negative, or neutral. For that First, we preprocess the dataset, then we extract adjectives with specific meanings from the dataset called feature vectors, then we select a list of feature vectors and then use machine learning based classification algorithms, namely: Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy and support vector. The machine follows WordNet-related instructions to extract similarities between content and content features. Finally, we evaluate the product's performance in terms of recall, precision, and accuracy. The project will comply with all relevant laws and regulations regarding data privacy and security. Sentiment analysis aims to determine the emotional tone behind the text, often used to gauge opinions, attitudes, and emotions expressed by individuals or communities. This abstract highlights the method's importance in understanding public sentiment, guiding decision-making, and analyzing social trends, particularly in the digital age.
